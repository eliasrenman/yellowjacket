Freestyle FPV quadcopter frame


This is a carbon fibre freestyle frame designed with modularity in mind.
The project is suitable for 5-inch to 7-inch propellers. Arms are available in squished-X configuration (5 inch) as well as deadcat configuration (5 or 7 inch).
The frame in it's current design is cut from sheets/plates of carbon fibre composite, 1mm for FPV-camera mount and bottom plate, 2 or 2.5mm for main plate and top plate and 4 or 5mm for motor arms. Additional mounts and parts are available as 3d-printable files.

The frame can be used with 30x30 (recommended for easy arm replacement) or 20x20 stacks. The frame is designed for a 20x20 VTX (Caddx Vista or analog) but can hold a full size DJI Air Unit using a TPU cage.
The frame is designed to carry an action camera like the GoPro Hero with low displacement on center of gravity.

All TPU is designed for 6mm knurled standoffs and WILL be lose and cause gyro noise if used with smaller standoffs.
