Freestyle FPV quadcopter frame


This is a carbon fibre freestyle frame designed with modularity in mind.
The project is suitable for 5-inch and 6-inch builds, however 7-inch arms are possible but not tested. Arms are available in squished-X configuration as well as deadcat configuration.
The frame in it's current design is cut from sheets/plates of carbon fibre composite, 1mm for FPV-camera mount and bottom plate, 2 or 2.5mm for main plate and top plate and 4 or 5mm for motor arms.

The frame can be used with 30x30 (recommended for easy arm replacement) or 20x20 stacks. The frame is designed for a 20x20 VTX (Caddx Vista or analog) but can hold a full size DJI Air Unit using a TPU cage.
The frame is designed to carry an action camera like the GoPro Hero with low displacement on center of gravity.
